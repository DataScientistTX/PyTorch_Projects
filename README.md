# PyTorch_Projects

Repo that stores all my PyTorch scripts from certain projects

Most of the functions are originally based on the "Inside Deep Learning" PyTorch book written by Edward Raff 

PyTorch_basics: An intro to PyTorch functions 

PyTorch_linear_reg: Training an ANN for a linear regression problem with different hidden layers 

PyTorch_class_2class: Training an ANN for a simple classification problem

PyTorch_class_ex2: Make moon dataset with higher noise. Trainin an ANN with different optimizers and batch sizes. Model evaluation using test data and different metrics (F1 scores and accuracy)

PyTorch_CNN: How to train a CNN for image data
